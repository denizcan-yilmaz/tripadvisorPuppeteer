    "review": "We are a RussianFamily and We visited Eskisehir for me to have an surgery operation.Since i was going to stay in hospital overnight i wanted to put my family in a well know city hotel.  We DIDNT  like the hotel for some reasons but the highlight was the attitude which my wife was exposed to yesterday lunch time by alacarte restaurant staff.  My wife and daughter took a table by window against city view in order to enjoy their lunch.The entire restaurant was empty with no-one sitting inside.But after awhile a restaurant staff warned my family and moved them from table to a dark corner side of the  restaurant showing reason that all tables by window are reserved( while entri restaurant was empty- review pics for visual reference)  I am asking now to hotel management what was the root reason of this rude behavior to move my family from their table and behave them rude and make them feel like invaluable !!???Racism  or personal satisfaction or poor management  or all???  I came to your hotel in order to take 5 star attitude not 3 star.Why you making your boss loose money if your management skills are equal to 3 star hotels quality since i decided to move from your hotel.  Who you are making your boss loose money and treating rude to my family??  Back to review  –¢oilet seat in pee Mirror fingers Table is dirty Conditioner not working  Water in shower is bad No drinking Water Reception girls always playing with phones unhappy with questions   I hope your boss reads it Pity that guys left that place into poor management  hands.‚Ä¶"

We enjoyed our balcony and had a beautiful breakfast at the terrace. The food was great, the  service  professional and  fast and the staff unusually friendly. Hotel is very close to the old part of the city known as Odunpazarƒ±. It takes ten minutes to walk down to the shops but unless you want to divorce your wife, I suggest you get a cab on the way back. It is very (very) steep! Our permanent home is in US and being retired we travel a lot. I must say this was one of the best and quietest places  (not the most expensive) we stayed. And the price was just incredible. It doesn't get any better folks..‚Ä¶"

As you enter the main reception the live palm trees and endless roof is a design i have never seen before.  The breakfast is amazing and top quality with a stunning view over the snowy roofs of the city below.  The suite was massive and very comfortable, probably the best bed we have ever slept in at a hotel. The only negative with the room was the constant sewage smell in the toilet.  Balcony views were amazing and staff are beyond helpful and friendly.  The spa is amazing and the massage was worth every penny.  We stayed at this hotel for our trip to Sogut to visit Ertugrul gazi and it is not too far only 45 minutes by car."

You will not regret it. At the end Eski≈üehir is not a town known for its beautiful view. One can prefer pools and some little green instead of an ordinary city view. Cleverly manufactured sound absorbing walls in common areas provide a silent, comfy and a nice atmosphere. Breakfast is very satisfying with lots of options, but cheese alternatives could be better. Spa is also good offering pools with different temperatures. Haven‚Äôt tried massages, but staff were looking promising. I had noticed dust in some harder to reach points.

We are very impressed with the breathtaking views from the hotel outside but the hotel had a few problems.  We booked a premium room but the sinks are outside in the room - so it really looks as if half the toilet is in the room - we did not like that at all. The WC side of the toilet was on the right hand side and it was stinking and the floor was sticky. It smelled like a public toilet. We asked them to change our room and the hotel was fully booked. The next day we requested to either downgrade us or move us to a suite room and we would pay the extra charge. The suite was available so we got ourselves downgraded to a deluxe room.

I love travelling and staying in nice hotels all around the world, but this unique hotel is undoubtedly one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in. Tasigo hotel is located on a hill, overlooking the city, and it is only a few minutes away (by taxi) from the city center. The contemporary interior design and the mixture of carefully-selected, lively colors at the lobby, in our room, and everywhere else in this hotel were outstanding. I was amazed by the elegantly curved corridor walls and the eye-catching lighting and d√©cor elements.

The people are extremely nice and respond to each of our needs. I had a Genius bonus for breakfast and there was no problem with that. The breakfast is a rich Turkish one and there was something for every taste. This is an excellent place to stay at!"

The room was super clean, and had the added benefit of including a sort of kitchenette in the room: sink, fridge, hot water kettle.  Some aspects of the accommodation were on the spartan side (one bath towel and one hand towel for two people), no decor to speak of.  Loads of storage space, lots of cabinets.  Breakfast was satisfactory; nothing special, but certainly sufficient.  In all, for the price, it was a really good value."

The man on the desk was just lovely and gave us a map and information on the area. It is in a great location and walking distance to everything. The only regret is that we did not have longer to stay here. I highly recommend this hotel. "

Also note that,  1) There were none of the coronavirus measures that I used to see in other Accor hotels (for example, the wooden stirrers were open) 2) If you are on the bigger side, you will not be able to squeeze in the shower. 3) Parking lot is insufficient  I think it is time Eskisehir is given a better hotel from the Accor range."

We also had an accident in the room and had to ask for a new quilt, it was ready in our room in 5 minutes. The price we paid for breakfast was 10.90TL per person and it was worth way more than that value, the variety and quality of the food was excellent.  In total, we stayed for two days, and our experience of ibis Eskisehir was very fulfilling. Every staff member we met had a positive and helpful attitude. Next time we visit the town, ibis will be my first choice."

The rooms are clean at the first look but it is kind of superficial (for instance check out the doors!!) Still, the basic cleanliness was ok if you don't look too carefully.   The furniture was nice, but the room was really small.  We preffered a garden view room instead of a train station view one. We didn't have any problems regarding any train noise. We didn't have breakfast so I cannot comment on it.   I would have given 3,5 stars if possible, since nothing is wrong about this hotel but nothing is spectecular either."

Kids slept on extended armchairs,not realy beds. We had also very strong parfum smell in the room. The bathroom room door was making a terrible noise so we woke up everytime someone used the bathroom. Last but most important thing RATESbwe paid in Expedia were 50% higher than rack rates.I asked about it and they could not explain at all.

The typical turkish method of hotel room repair, of cardboard pieces to replace lost chrome bits, or loose toilet fittings, was evident here, but I could be considered overly picky.

It was difficult to communicate with the hotel staff when we wanted to arrange our trip to Istanbul but thankfully we all managed and regardless of the language barrier, they were still very helpful. I would suggest that they would use better pictures to depict their hotel because it's located in such a busy street and we did not expect that when we arrived.

Needs improvement:  - While I did not have much of a problem with that since I was there with the family for 1 night only, I suggest one avoid the basic room type if the stay is longer. Our room was of that type, was dark at all times, and did only have a window which opened to some sort of a terrace (I guess!!!) so the window was only there for some ventilation purposes... - Shower gels, shampoos etc will be appreciated in the bathroom..."

    "review": "Great location. However, it can be very noisy at night, especially on weekends, since it is located in a very vibrant location in Eskisehir. (There is a bar/restaurant and a hotel with a restaurant on top floor right next to it).  Very good breakfast and staff is friendly as well.  Our room was great. The design and quality were top notch, it was one of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, not just for Eskisehir, but world-wide.  Overall a very good experience."

    "review": "We stayed 2 nights and our room was overlooking the river. Both sides of the river are lined with cafes. The hotel is located between 2 supermarkets and there were more shops behind it.  The hotel is popular with local clientale as evident with the breakfast crowd. No complains about the Turkish breakfast served of mainly cheese (wide varienty), salad, yoghurt, dried fruits. There's 2 choice of hot food of fries and hard boiled eggs.  The room was new and has a little balcony facing the river. The music from the cafe downstairs and human traffic could be heard when the balcony glass doors are opened.  For the location, we will stay again when visiting Eskisehir as the Porsuk cut through the centre of the city where the hotel is located."

Most of the highlighted destinations are within walking distance, and those a little beyond can be accessed by the tram waiting just round the corner a few blocks away.  The reception staff welcome you with a warm smile and quickly direct you to your room - almost no waiting. Room facilities are excellent with TV, wi-fi, fridge, air-conditioning and safe. Some rooms overlook the river and its beautiful surroundings. Cleanliness is superb. Interior design and utilization of space are remarkable.  Breakfast is a feast. The beds are so comfortable. Silence is almost a motto in the whole building. I would like to thank those who made our stay here a pleasant experience."

The legendary mayor Yilmaz Buyukersen is an ex-rector of the Eskisehir Anadolu University.  He made Eskisehir an incredible culture city.  The city is situated in the middle of Turkey. A stream called Porsuk Stream passes through the city. They built a beach along the Porsuk River by collecting water and bringing sand there. They manufacture gondolas in the municipal manufacturing mill. You can glide down the Porsuk stream in a gondola. There are marvelous iron bridges across the Porsuk Stream.

It is loated just 5 minutes walk away from the urban tramway station by which you can go to every touristic location in the city. I would advice you to go to \"Kentpark\" it will take 15 to 20 minutes with the tramway. Also there are so many restaurants & night clubs in the region so you could just stay around for lunch and/or dinner and after. Another close-by touristic location is \"Odunpazarƒ±\", you can visit the region by a 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel. During reservation prefer a room with a view of \"Porsuk Stream\".

Nicely decorated.  The staff were sincere and they really tried hard to do their jobs well.  The room facing the canal was beautiful, despite the construction going on in front and a bit of noise Saturday night.  Not the best for a light sleeper but if you are not a light sleeper and enjoy seeing a bit of street life without even leaving the room, ask for the canal view.  Breakfast was acceptable.  My recommendation would be that the staff should learn more about Eskisehir so they can advise people on things to do, where to go, etc.   I would definitely stay at this hotel when I return to Eskisehir."

That's why I dare to explain more about the hotel. As someone who has worked as a receptionist and manager for many years in 3 and 4 star hotels, I am surprised that the receptionists were busy with their phones instead of paying attention to the guests and greeting them. Upon entering the standard room, I expected the bathroom to be without water stains, faucets and toilets seat, which unfortunately was not the case, but I also had common experiences in 5-star hotels in Turkey. we should have pay to have toothbrush and toothpaste in the room, which was very upsetting and surprising for me. The bed was not made in any way for a hotel. The sheets were not suitable for the bed and one side of the bed was without sheets. I hope this way of making bed was by mistake and only happened for our room and this is not the form of all other hotel beds. Fortunately, I only stayed one night at the hotel and returned to the hotel to relax after a tour of the beautiful city of Eskisehir. The bathroom door was difficult to open and close, and I pass this case and the bathroom paint stains and hair inside the toilet and the glass stains quickly. We entered the restaurant for breakfast but no one was in front of us to greet and guide us. The breakfast buffet was as good as a hotel and nothing more or less. For breakfast in a corner by the window, we set the table in the secluded part of the hall. As soon as I sat down, I noticed that three of the restaurant staff were sitting in a corner behind the table, talking. When they saw us, they got up and realized that One of them is a restaurant host. Mrs. EZGI After breakfast, we packed up and left the hotel.

Staff was lovely in every department of this hotel, rooms were nice and clean, breakfast was to die for.  Centrally located if you don't mind walking a bit, or taxi to the town centre is about 20TL. They've got a lovely restaurant in the garden, if you wanna have a drink at the end of the day. Eskisehir itself is a lovely town with lot's of parks, restaurants and bars, great for families. We're definately coming back to Eskisehir and stay at Ramada Wyndam Plaza again. Thank you to the staff to make our stay enjoyable. "

We enjoyed in particular the breakfasts, there were several options available for the guests, staff was very friendly and gracious. The main challenge we had was parking, hotel does not have adequate parking space, one night I had to park in front of the hotel. Secondly our room did receive some smoke when we run AC. When we did not run AC, this was not an issue but with the AC we definitely received smoke from lower floors. Wish all hotels in Turkey can be smoke free actually.

    "review": "Stayed for 5days on business in a standard room. Room was very clean and modern, exactly what you need when staying away. The bathroom had a large shower but no bath. Breakfast is standard for Turkey, if a little strange for a English person. There seems to be no differentiation between breakfast and lunch with chip and roasted veg on offer. The location is a real winner, near to shops (big shopping centre like Westfield) restaurants, and some nice bars Dublin is a very nice one. Would definatey be happy to return to this hotel on my next visit."

But if it was on the crowded holiday days, the hotel service could be interrupted(we went there on the days of Bayram, so the room cleaning hadn't been done for two days. But they gave us a bottle of wine for their excuse and didn't take one-day room payment; which was adorable). They don't have any playing room, so at nights there's nothing to do with your children.

    "review": "I did use the service of this hotel during  28-29th of November, this date happens to be a national celebration day in Turkey. We were there to celebrate and enjoy. But really, the staff of this hotel ruined out entire experience. Seemingly polite but really rude... The breakfast was really bad, considering the traditional Turkish breakfast. Additionally, the breakfast and lunch rooms are so small that you need to wait at least 20 mins to get a table! really ridiculous. Please do not waste your time and money, there are much better hotels in Eskisehir, try any other one out."

The hotel itself is brand new and our room and bathroom were spacious with lots of cupboard space. Very comfortable beds with good bedding. Everything is very clean.The minibar is free - filled with soft drinks and water. You also have a kettle and lovely cups with tea and coffee provided every day.

The one disappointment (and I hope it gets fixed soon) is that the wifi was unreliable in my room and not great in the lobby either.

It's located in the vibrant touristic neighborhood of the city, in walking distance to most of the city's touristic destinations.   When you first arrive, you are greeted with a drink. Check-in procedures are quick and flawless. We stayed in room no 7 and it was perfect in all sense: decoration, comfort, cleanliness, sleep quality, everything was impeccable.   The breakfast was legendary: it was both a visual and gastronomic feast.   Despite being more expensive that many hotels in town, I think this is \"the\" hotel to stay at when in Eski≈üehir.‚Ä¶"

    "reviewtitle": "Renovating and saying wrong prices",
    "review": "I've stayed in several hostels especially since in Turkey it's difficult to use booking, but only now I feel the need to write a review about it.  I was just traveling through being very tired. A bit unlucky someone took my luggage by accident in the airport. So bad sleep and stress. But they were renovating and there was all day very loud noise in the hostel. So no resting.  It would have been nice to be notified about that. Girl in the evening was very friendly. But that day I asked about a bus to the airport. They might not realize I understand Turkish at some level. A bigger guy discussed it with I think a cleaning lady and they needed to know where I was from. Then just because I was from Belgium they decided to say no and said a taxi was about 50 lira. That's totally not true though. I first took a taxi and the correct price is on the screen. It was 33 lira. So I had my luggage back. Then I noticed there was a university at the airport and I saw busses constantly riding. A very nice young lady working there said I could take easily a bus to centre and checked me in with her card.  I think especially for a hostel this is very inappropriate behavior. The reason I choose this one and not the other actually nicer one was too many stairs and the deeps hostel in Ankara is very nice and helpful and wouldn't do such a thing. I'm getting tired with people thinking just because you are from Europe assuming you have money. I live under European poverty limit (healthissues) and can barely survive in my country as food and rent and co  is ridiculously expensive. Can I travel? It's basically cheaper than staying in the country sometimes. Anyways Moovit is a good application and works very well in Eski≈üehir. It told me perfectly how to go to the big busstation.  As most don't speak English I would advice to put a note that there are two kitchen. Cause you see the small one and most assume there is just one.  Beds are good. Lockers too. Showers too. The table next to the bed is a bit too low, because of that you need to close it at night and you can't put your stuff like phone etc anywhere.  All the other people were very nice though.‚Ä¶"

We stayed in the hotel about 10 days. Lobby saloon with modern design was our favorite in the office comfort with free internet and tea and water and with toilets in few steps. We solved parking problem with municipal parking area with cheap prices on the next big street which is one  hundred meters far from Hotel. We used the price difference for dinner.  Good breakfast according to price. Next two restaurants and one small bakery were perfect for stores and dinner. We will stay there in future again."

The entrance is poor. The building is new though. They asked for the payment before entering the room which is a negative. They insisted to prepare the invoice the night before sleeping since there would not be a knowledgable person to prepare in the morning. Breakfast was at 08:00. They prepared a special one for my early checkout. At least it was ready. Breakfast is average though. My room was small but newly built and decorated. However there are very many details which are not right. No place for soap during shower. No extra towels for shower. Had to ask them to bring. Towels were clean.  No light switch near the bed. Direct lighting from the ceiling which is disturbing when laying in the bed.  The furniture looks poor. There was no smell in the room. The bed and matresses were comfortable. The backside look to nearby apartments so you cannot have real privacy. This hotel is worth to stay for the price they charge, only. Can stay solo again for business overnight stays again.‚Ä¶"

The breakfast is a large selection of fruits, cheeses, pastries, cereals and hot items. It is worth the trip up to the top floor to check it out. I was very happy with it.

The location is wonderful, overlooking the Porsuk River and right in the middle of all the attractions and bars/cafes areas. The rooms are more that of a 5 star hotel rather than the 3 star that the Ad Life is listed as online which was a nice surprise. The TV selection was great and the bed was comfortable and clean. The only thing stopping this from fulfilling its' potential is the lack of leisure facilities such as a spa or fitness centre, otherwise this would be well above 3 star. Breakfast was good and the view from the restaraunt is wonderful. I would highly recommend‚Ä¶"

    "review": "The Black Hotel experience was very satisfying for us. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable. Everything was functioning well. I also liked the breakfast, it contains cheese varieties and vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers, Pastries were also more than sufficient. The hotel is in the city centre and very close to main train station (10 min.s walk) plus, it was silent. There are restaurants and pubs very close like 5 min.s walk.  Although our room was a non-smoking room, at night there was a very little smoke smell, it might come from a smoking-allowed rooms? I don‚Äôt know but it might be an improvement point for the hotel.  But in overall I strongly recommend this hotel to whoever pass by Eski≈üehir."

    "review": "I stayed here for a weekend with my boyfriend and another couple. The hotel's location is extremely central and near the river and bar street, which appealed to us. The room felt a bit dusty and the air conditioner wasn't working properly sometimes.  The hotel's concept was interesting, and the bathroom door was as though my mind was being tricked because it is so black that it looks like you can see through it. Curtains in the room were not blackout. Breakfast is average."

    "review": "Let me first mention that the room price of the hotel is very adventageous. Almost a dormitory price... Compared to what you pay the hotel offers quite much: Large rooms, comfortable beds and proximity to historical Odunpazari center. First room I was offered had a heavy cigarette odour, the second room was OK. The bathroom was not dirty but I perceived a superficial cleaning. The cleaning staff must spend more time in the room and make an in-depth cleaning. There is no air conditioning but I could sleep without it quite good even in mid-summer. I may stay here again during next trips to Eski≈üehir."

We were upgraded to the suites - plenty of room (although the kitchen was empty apart from a microwave. But we did not ask for cooking equipment). The hotel cafe is very good. Plenty of choice and a good breakfast and dinner. Again, the staff in the cafe were very friendly and offered food samples. All the chefs had a grasp of English (at least in food names) and went out of their way to ensure good service."

We obviously went to tip him as we do in every hotel and he was quite embarrassed and didn‚Äôt want to accept the money. We have travelled the whole of Turkey, mostly staying in 5 star hotels and have not met such a humble, lovely man. A true credit to this hotel.

Breakfast was very good for a three star hotel.Most four star hotels in Europe don't serve this much variety.However there was no fresh coffee but instant coffee and mate in packs.We met nice people at reception,they presented us  a map of places we should visit. The only thing that bothered us was the lack of light in the bathroom.Foreign tourists will certainly want to watch some tv channel at least in English,however there is none.‚Ä¶"

I engaged the services for the \"kese\", body scrub and it was incredible to see the amount of dead skin cells being scrubbed off and washed away, feeling clean like never before. The service less than the entrance fee.  One can remain in the pool area for as long you want but I went to the upper floor for an hour long soothing and relaxing massage.

I requested 3 floor room and I got it. But I had to change it withing 5 min, since door lock of the room was broken, and doors didn't closed properly; and since it was top floor bathroom ceiling was horribly molded. Luckily I got other room fast and in better condition. But bathroom was still quite dirty and poorly maintained (shower doors did closed). Most disappointing was breakfast - way before breakfast finish time I could find peace of bread, 5 olives and butter (no meat, no vegetables, no cheese) and black tea (NO COFFEE?). I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone until it solves all its issues.  Location was very good, but its center of market - noise is inevitable.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "When we entered the hotel, it was without a lift and just undergoing various repairs; but, by the time we were leaving, it was already running. A good thing.    We planned to stay just 1 night, but - pleasantly surprised by the beauty of Eskisehir, a town situated on 2 rivers, prolonged our stay to even 3 nights.     Together with Amasya, Eskisehir became ours' favourite city in Turkey.    As especially interesting sightseeing place, I would recommend to anyone the old city in Eskisehir (Odunpazari).    Our next trip will be either to Amasya, or Eskisehir, or both towns (depending on time and money, of course).     Anyway, if we go to Eskisehir, we'll certainly stay at Deda Thermal Hotel.    And, although it was not important to us, maybe we shoud add a location of a thermal bath, just on the other side of a street.    We like their owner and receptionists, who speak very good English and are always so willing to help you with any kind of information.

Talking about the hotel them self, honestly I love they are loby who full of lavender and classic touch of the furniture.   The room size normal the bath room have litle problem with they are shower who broken so the water come out from anywhere. We staying 2 night and they are not clean our room even to clean the rubbish. But, we still can handel for this.   The most Iam focus is the sound from the other room. We are staying in the room near the reception and when people in 2nd floor walking we can hear the sound from wooden floor is really distrubing.  For the breakfirst they are done so well, and the man who take care this place is really friendly and nice.  overall, still recommend this place for you to stay. Just ask them to give you room in the 2nd floor to avoid the disturbing sound during you stay.‚Ä¶"

The room was very nice, though not quite as big/grand as I would have expected for over 200TL. No complaints though, even if having one tv channel in English was a bit limited.

We had wonderful servers who went out of their way to make sure we were happy with our service, down to the wonderful food we ate! I would say, for Turkish cuisine this was a fine place to go.

The area around the hotel is very quaint and lots of interesting places to see. definitely recommended."

The service was not good. They bring you some food without asking your choice and when you order omlette it takes 20 minutes and they served other customers  who came later than me. They gave one plate of things for 3 people and it was not enough and not my choice. They should improve their breakfast but otherwise very good experience.

The staff spoke just enough English between them and together with their computer managed to direct us to the Museum and an afternoon's adventure. They were so helpful and friendly. Lovely Konak, beautifully restored backing onto an arcade with nice shops and restaurants where we ate our evening meal and wonderful breakfast. It is situated in the old part of Eskisehir and a delight to walk around, chat to the locals and look in some of their amazing shops - the toy shop was my favourite where the toys were made on site. Just delightful.... The Firuz was our base to explore this fascinating area. It was organized by Rock Valley Tours in Urgup.‚Ä¶"

The rooms are spacious unlike the similar hotels in that area. Very comfortable and big bed, duck feather blankets, pillow menu, complimentary water & tea & coffee in the room. Bathroom is very nice, handmade decorated sinks made of K√ºtahya tile.  The decoration is perfect, you realize the beauty of the wooden floors & ceilings, the atmosphere inside the building is very cosy. Its very close to main attractions of the old city. Nice area to stay. The breakfast is one of the best ever, the homemade jams, egg choices, tasty cheeses and different fresh vegetables and various types of b√∂rek & breads.  I will definitely come back to this hotel whenever I come to this city again.  It is a 5 star comfort but a VIP boutique experience.  Thanks again and hope to be back soon.‚Ä¶"

The welcoming and rather friendly staff with an infectious smile is an admired selling point. The hotel like elsewhere in the city is very clean. The suite room that we stayed in was large and the bed was fantastic. Because of the paucity of foreign tourists , as I thought, there was a lack of an English T.V. channel. The breakfast was basic but if you want eggs you can ask for. The only negative point about this hotel was the lack of an elevator (lift) which may make the life of someone with angina or joint problems a little difficult especially if your room was on a high floor level"

The location was very central to the city sights; the room was immaculately clean; breakfast was delicious and served in an artful way by friendly and helpful staff; and most of all, the hosts went well beyond expectations in assisting us during our stay.  When we arrived late in the evening, we discovered that my reservation made through Hotels.com had omitted the information that there would be 3 adults (me,my husband, and adult son) sharing a room.  The young man on night duty was a bit uncomfortable with his level of English comprehension and, although it was late, called the owner who spoke with me by phone regarding how to handle the situation (since the room had been prepaid with Hotel.com).  With absolutely no hint of annoyance, the night staff of two young men carried a large roll-away bed up three flights of stairs and set it up in our room.  As a second example, we were interested in visiting the Phrygian Valley and did not have a car.  The young man working the front desk spent considerable effort calling around to taxi companies and private tour guides.  When it turned out that arranging a company tour was not financially feasible, he helped us plan a way to make the trip via public transportation involving a bus trip to a small village and hiring a local to drive us to the sights of interest.  The trip worked out really well and we strongly recommend a visit to see the amazing historical sights and spectacular landscape.  We highly recommend the Bello Butik Hotel and would definitely stay there again should we be fortunate enough to visit Eskisehir again.‚Ä¶"

It is close to the shopping centers, places of interest and nightlife. Unfortunately, because it is located on a busy street, the traffic can be heard incessantly. The reception and staff were quite helpful and friendly.  The rooms are small, but spacious and clean; the amenities plenty and of quality. Breakfast is served however we did not have any, so I cannot say anything about it. I would recommend Bello Butik for short stays."

We were shown to our room along bright, clean landings. Our room was immaculately clean and very fresh. The bathroom was perhaps a little small, never the less, it was clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable and we slept very well. The ambience is quiet and tranquil may be because there are no bar facilities and bar noise. There was a mini bar available containing soft drinks and water. The price for these drinks were very reasonable.  The breakfast at the top Sky lounge was remarkable. Freshly presented breakfast fare. Hot and Cold food. Good quality.  There are plenty of caf√©s and bars within minutes -if not seconds walking distance. Good quality Wifi was readily available.

Everything works.  There are safes in the rooms.  The wireless internet is fabulous, and they post the password next to your telephone.  The rooms are clean, the A/C is easy to operate, the windows have screens.  The breakfast buffet is rich and tasty, and the staff at the front desk is friendly and helpful.  Too good to be true?  It is.  Unfortunately, the whole place smells like cigarette smoke.  If only they had smoking and non-smoking floors, this place would be fantastic.  If you are bothered by cigarette smoke, do not stay here, as you will be very uncomfortable.    Turkey is slowly realizing the dangers of cigarette smoking, and I have no doubt that sooner or later this hotel will realize the benefits of separating out their smokers--and maybe, if all goes well, elminating them all together from the premises.‚Ä¶"

The concierge and his staff, they knew it all and one more! They gave us very good advice on everything.  3. the housekeeping is clean and quick and deserves trust, we loved their honesty; when in the morning we left behind us bunches of golden bracelets and banknotes not suitable for hospital life, we have found everything piled over the desk, always always always, and nothing was EVER missing.

There was a disgusting and very strong mold odor in the room. I opened the door of the bathroom and it was clear that the mold odor was coming from there. The ceiling was hanging loose and I felt like it could collapse any moment. The water in the bath tub was literally leaking so the floor was super wet when I finished showering, which is very dangerous. The things in the bathroom were also disgusting, the trash bin and toilet brush were rusty. How much does it cost to change a damn trash bin???

Once we left, the car was valleyed back and again they helped with the luggage. I would stay again at VIP if in Eskisehir, and would recommend it to "

There is a police station nearby so you know it's a safe environment.  The place has a kitchen and everything for your stay, you can prepare a meal there if you wish. The rooms are clean and smell good.  The common place of the hostel is very comfy, it has a piano, a few guitars and even a drum kit. We spent a good 10 minutes there everytime we went out.  Emre, the host is a very friendly person and he always welcomes you with a smile.  There is a pub in the \"Barlar Sokagi\" with the same name, and you should definitely give it a visit. The place itself is very cozy and the prices are excellent. They have a few of their own cocktail recipies which were very tasty.  Overall, I would recommend Dudes Rooms for young adults who wish to spend a quality time in Eskisehir with their friends. 9/10‚Ä¶"

We jammed here for a while before going out! So it‚Äôs a perfect place to pregame! The kitchen has everything you are going to need. This hostel even has a terrace you can go out and smoke and maybe have a little party there : ) The communal room is also a great workspace, it has big tables and fast wi fi.  The bed was comfy and the sheets were good quality and clean. Did I even mention our room had a private bathroom!  The hostel is in the city center, close to anywhere you want to go (Eskisehir is a small town).  It is easy to find a park place for your car.  Emre, the staff, is very friendly and helpful. Plus he has a great music taste!   Thanks for everything! Couldn‚Äôt be better. I‚Äôd recommend everyone!‚Ä¶"

We spent the whole day at Midas Han, went there early in the morning, then had a very detailed tour with Ben, then had lunch at Midas Han and continued our archeological tour in the area until sunset and then headed home. So, we did not stay at night but nevertheless experienced the place.   The location is quite unique as it's placed just in the middle of the \"history\" with an outstanding view of Yazilikaya. The overall atmosphere is  comfortable yet humble, exactly what you need from a base camp when exploring a site such as Phrygian Valley.   Ben's guidance is priceless: he's very knowledgeable about the area and the history. In fact he's too knowledgeable and it might be overwhelming time to time in case you are not that into archeology.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place and Ben's guiding services if you intend to explore Phrygian Valley.‚Ä¶"

All of the best sites are located within easy walking distance of the hotel.  Midas Han is located on the outskirts of the village of √áukurca and has open views out over fields to Gerdekkaya Anti, a rocky tufa outcrop with a huge temple facade carved into its face.   The small cluster of buildings at Midas Han are recently constructed but in a very traditional style, using locally produced stone and timber. The attention to detail, both in the buildings and their contents is really noteworthy and shows that the whole place, including the beautiful garden has been lovingly crafted by the owners. The main building is a large two-story stone structure with a long timber balcony that looks out over the fields. Inside is an open-plan communal dining area and lounge with lots of interesting artefacts on the walls and beams, from Anatolian ceramics to old farm equipment and even an old bird cage! A place of real character!  Our room was very comfortable and traditionally appointed, with a wood-burning stove and en-suite toilet and shower with hot water all the time. Some of the other rooms are heated with radiators. The price for our accommodation included a delicious, traditional Turkish evening meal and breakfast. Fresh g√∂zleme is prepared on one of several ovens in the garden.  One of the owners, who used to work as an archaeology teacher, even took us on a walk out to the nearby Midas City and really brought the place to life with his good-humoured and fascinating tour of this spectacular site.  A visit to Midas Han is a must for any traveller to this part of Phrygia.   ‚Ä¶"

    "review": "G√ºzelcamli, een kleine locatie aan de kust, niet ver van Kusadasi .. maar tegelijk een totaal ander Turkije.  Voor wie de massa en het massatoerisme wil ontlopen.  Guzelcamli zelf is een kuststadje, met rechts van de hoofdbaan best wel veel logeermogelijkheden (vooral vakantieflats, ..), maar links van diezelfde baan een nog redelijk authentiek stadje met een aantal familiepensionnetjes.  Ter plekke paar bezocht en uiteindelijk bij Sefer en Dudu belandt in 26 Eskisehir pension.  Dat hebben we ons niet beklaagd.  Uiterst vriendelijke ontvangst waarbij Sefer je graag wat Turks aanleert, een prachtig zicht vanop het terras waar je ontbijt (zonsondergang boven Samos!) .. een heerlijk ontbijt trouwens, met elke ochtend wel enkele 'speciallekes', speciaal klaargemaakt door Dudu.  En je eet je buikje rond, daar zorgt Sefer wel voor die zelf komt aanvullen als je de weg naar de 'selfservice' niet lijkt te vinden.  ;-)   De kamers zelf waren klein .. heel klein zelfs .. maar piccobello in orde (en dagelijks onderhouden).  MEt z'n vieren hadden we 2 kamers wat ons prive terras bezorgde .. vele malen groter dan beide kamers samen.  Perfect om buiten te leven, wat je in het turkse klimaat sowieso doet.  Ps airco was er niet, maar gezien prive terras konden we zonder problemen ramen en deuren wagenwijd openlaten en koel zeebriesje overtrof elke airco.  Dat Sefer bij ons vertrek in de wagen sprong om ons en onze rugzakken naar de bushalte te voeren maakte ons verblijf alleen maar meer 'af' .. een adresje om naar terug te keren.  En dat is blijkbaar niet alleen onze mening : heel wat gasten leken stamgasten die Sefer, Dudu en de zonen kenden en er ook de avond samen mee doorbrachten .. de saz muziek was heerlijk om horen.  PS Naast Guzelcamli heb je natuurpark met verschillende supermooie strandjes .. zorg alleen dat je de laatste dolmus niet mist. Na zonsondergang blijken wilde honden en wilde zwijnen er het voor het zeggen te hebben en elkaar op te jagen ... Wist niet iedereen in ons gezelschap te appricieren (zeker niet toen dat op paar meter van ons was), gelukkig opgepikt door de jandarma die ons lift richting stadje gaf.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "Owing to work-travel, I have stayed here often. It is set up for travelers on the highway to/from Ankara so most people roll in at night and leave in the morning, but some of us end up staying here more often. I am always happy to stay here because it is clean, set back far enough from the highway to be quiet (especially if your room faces the back of the hotel), and there is everything you need here -- a restaurant, a little store, a petrol station, and the usual fascinating Turkish rest-stop things like statues and gardens and gazebos and stray dogs. The staff are very nice, there is a breakfast room (the breakfast is not awesome but it is adequate), a comfortable TV room/lounge, and good wifi. The price is very reasonable. It is not an obvious place to stay (there are nicer places in Eskisehir and Ankara, and Polatli is also an option if you are going to visit King Midas), but it is a good place to stay! (I have also stayed at the TSOF motel near Kirsehir, but I like the Sivrihisar one the best.)‚Ä¶"

    "review": "Due to a holiday weekend and a last minute reservation, we were able to find a room only in this hotel. It's sad that it is called a hotel because it was made out from a small apartment building. The stinging odor in the rooms was overwhelmingly bothersome. The rooms reeked cigarette smoke and old humid walls. Each room has an outrageously old wall papers which also smelled disgusting. The staff seemed pretty disinterested. The beds are very uncomfortable and dusty. The bathrooms don't have shower cabins and the faucets hardly run any water. The floors are extremely dirty. The breakfast was ridiculous as well. No one should stay there as the conditions of the hotel are very unhealthy. "
