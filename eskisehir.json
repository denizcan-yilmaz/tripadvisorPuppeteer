    "review": "We are a RussianFamily and We visited Eskisehir for me to have an surgery operation.Since i was going to stay in hospital overnight i wanted to put my family in a well know city hotel.  We DIDNT  like the hotel for some reasons but the highlight was the attitude which my wife was exposed to yesterday lunch time by alacarte restaurant staff.  My wife and daughter took a table by window against city view in order to enjoy their lunch.The entire restaurant was empty with no-one sitting inside.But after awhile a restaurant staff warned my family and moved them from table to a dark corner side of the  restaurant showing reason that all tables by window are reserved( while entri restaurant was empty- review pics for visual reference)  I am asking now to hotel management what was the root reason of this rude behavior to move my family from their table and behave them rude and make them feel like invaluable !!???Racism  or personal satisfaction or poor management  or all???  I came to your hotel in order to take 5 star attitude not 3 star.Why you making your boss loose money if your management skills are equal to 3 star hotels quality since i decided to move from your hotel.  Who you are making your boss loose money and treating rude to my family??  Back to review  –¢oilet seat in pee Mirror fingers Table is dirty Conditioner not working  Water in shower is bad No drinking Water Reception girls always playing with phones unhappy with questions   I hope your boss reads it Pity that guys left that place into poor management  hands.‚Ä¶"

I fell in love with the architecture of the building and really impressed by the quality and creativity of the materials used. I later found out that the people who built, own and manage the  hotel have extensive experience running resorts both in Turkey and in Central Asian countries. The name? Three syllables are made of from first two letters of the last names of the owners. I found out the first two (Ta-banca and si-yahi) but could not find the third. We enjoyed our balcony and had a beautiful breakfast at the terrace. The food was great, the  service  professional and  fast and the staff unusually friendly. Hotel is very close to the old part of the city known as Odunpazarƒ±. It takes ten minutes to walk down to the shops but unless you want to divorce your wife, I suggest you get a cab on the way back. It is very (very) steep! Our permanent home is in US and being retired we travel a lot. I must say this was one of the best and quietest places  (not the most expensive) we stayed. And the price was just incredible. It doesn't get any better folks..‚Ä¶"

As you enter the main reception the live palm trees and endless roof is a design i have never seen before.  The breakfast is amazing and top quality with a stunning view over the snowy roofs of the city below.  The suite was massive and very comfortable, probably the best bed we have ever slept in at a hotel. The only negative with the room was the constant sewage smell in the toilet.  Balcony views were amazing and staff are beyond helpful and friendly.  The spa is amazing and the massage was worth every penny.  We stayed at this hotel for our trip to Sogut to visit Ertugrul gazi and it is not too far only 45 minutes by car."

You will not regret it. At the end Eski≈üehir is not a town known for its beautiful view. One can prefer pools and some little green instead of an ordinary city view. Cleverly manufactured sound absorbing walls in common areas provide a silent, comfy and a nice atmosphere. Breakfast is very satisfying with lots of options, but cheese alternatives could be better. Spa is also good offering pools with different temperatures. Haven‚Äôt tried massages, but staff were looking promising. I had noticed dust in some harder to reach points.

The hotel room was clean, and comfortable, the staff are friendly and professional. I was supposed to stay there for three nights, but I extended it for three more nights (everyday I extended for the next one).   Just one little thing that annoyed me during my stay was the room key, it didn't work all the time, I had to take it to the front desk to reset it almost everyday. I hope they get this issue fixed.  In general, this hotel would be my first choice if I ever visited the lovely Eskisehir again, and highly recommend it for everyone :)"

It was a busy time with many families but the food was quite good. On the last day, I requested a very early wake-up call and the front desk clerk offered a take-away breakfast for my convenience.

The room was super clean, and had the added benefit of including a sort of kitchenette in the room: sink, fridge, hot water kettle.  Some aspects of the accommodation were on the spartan side (one bath towel and one hand towel for two people), no decor to speak of.  Loads of storage space, lots of cabinets.  Breakfast was satisfactory; nothing special, but certainly sufficient.  In all, for the price, it was a really good value."

Keep in mind if you have claustrophobia.  Other way-out is there is just one electricity plug in the rooms. If you have two phone to charge or one phone and one laptop, you can not charge them together. One device to charge at a time. This is unacceptable in such modern world.

But the receptionist gave me the closest room to the bars and smoking. I complained and i request them to change my room, but they said the hotel is fully booked. At my previous stay, i had same problems but because of the good location, i gave here another chance. This was the last, i will never stay here again. "

The Lonely Planet guide for Turkey comments on this hotel building being converted from former use as a silo, but this isn't as exciting as it sounds - the building now just looks similar to any mid-rise building.  The best feature of the hotel was the location, immediately adjacent to the entrance to \"Bar Street\" and just three minutes walk from the main shopping street.  Apart from that, the hotel was clean and the facilities satisfactory.  One negative for me was that despite pre-paying on the Accor Hotels website, my card was charged again on arrival.

The breakfast is sufficient for that price. you can order some extra paid food for breakfast. I had fresh orange juice (9 TRY). The only flaw I see is the bathroom/room design. The toilet and sink was in the bathroom but the shower was in the other corner of the room. You take your shower and when you are out, you are in the middle of the room next to the bed. It is clear they made this due to space issues but it is still a strange design. The attached photos are actual ones taken by me. I recommend this hotel. Thanks to the staff (Miss Aleyna and a one gentleman working in the same shift)."

Even though it came highly recommended by friends and TripAdvisor, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get the same ‚Äòat home‚Äô feel... but lo and behold, I was wrong.  The front desk is friendly as are breakfast servers and floor crew. They just have smiles on their faces and ask what they could do for you all the time.  The rooms are compact, but cones with everything you need. The bathrooms are brand new and all very clean! The location is right at center of everything, walking distance to shopping, bullet train, restaurants and the tram.  I‚Äôm so happy to have found my new go to place in Eski≈üehir!"

The room I have stayed in was airless, and the housekeeping manager was very rude, although they left no \"do not disturb\" sign in the room. The washrooms does not feel sterile. It was a poor experience overall."

You need to specifically state that you want a non-smoking room. This hotel may also be a bit difficult for you If you are too sensitive to parfum-like smells, "

They were all so friendly and genuinely concerned. Nurhan Onur was amazing and especially Yasemin Azrak. Yasemin was so helpful whenever we needed anything. She always had a smile on her face and made our stay that much more pleasant and enjoyable. We will definitely be staying again next year when we go back!  -Hediye"

I traveled to Eskisehir for the first time and enjoyed all aspects of my trip except the hotel. The hotel was selected through ratings and comments on various websites. That's why I dare to explain more about the hotel. As someone who has worked as a receptionist and manager for many years in 3 and 4 star hotels, I am surprised that the receptionists were busy with their phones instead of paying attention to the guests and greeting them. Upon entering the standard room, I expected the bathroom to be without water stains, faucets and toilets seat, which unfortunately was not the case, but I also had common experiences in 5-star hotels in Turkey. we should have pay to have toothbrush and toothpaste in the room, which was very upsetting and surprising for me. The bed was not made in any way for a hotel. The sheets were not suitable for the bed and one side of the bed was without sheets. I hope this way of making bed was by mistake and only happened for our room and this is not the form of all other hotel beds. Fortunately, I only stayed one night at the hotel and returned to the hotel to relax after a tour of the beautiful city of Eskisehir. The bathroom door was difficult to open and close, and I pass this case and the bathroom paint stains and hair inside the toilet and the glass stains quickly. We entered the restaurant for breakfast but no one was in front of us to greet and guide us. The breakfast buffet was as good as a hotel and nothing more or less. For breakfast in a corner by the window, we set the table in the secluded part of the hall. As soon as I sat down, I noticed that three of the restaurant staff were sitting in a corner behind the table, talking. When they saw us, they got up and realized that One of them is a restaurant host. Mrs. EZGI After breakfast, we packed up and left the hotel. At the time of the check out as the chek in the receptionist preferred her cell phone rather than hotel guests. I will definitely travel to Eskisehir but not to Merlot Hotel.‚Ä¶"

The breakfast had so many options to overwhelm you the first day.  There is a chef that will make omelets for free.  For lunch, there are two restaurants and several places to eat near by.  The area is being developed with shopping centers and is walking distance (15 minutes) to Espark.

Staff was lovely in every department of this hotel, rooms were nice and clean, breakfast was to die for.  Centrally located if you don't mind walking a bit, or taxi to the town centre is about 20TL. They've got a lovely restaurant in the garden, if you wanna have a drink at the end of the day. Eskisehir itself is a lovely town with lot's of parks, restaurants and bars, great for families.

Only downside, windows didnt open and the double bed was 2 single mattresses. On my own not a problem, with a partner it could be annoying. Theres a department store/shopping mall opposite the hotel with a foodcourt and supermarket, and 10 liras gets you to the train station by taxi.

The main challenge we had was parking, hotel does not have adequate parking space, one night I had to park in front of the hotel. Secondly our room did receive some smoke when we run AC. When we did not run AC, this was not an issue but with the AC we definitely received smoke from lower floors. Wish all hotels in Turkey can be smoke free actually.

    "review": "Stayed for 5days on business in a standard room. Room was very clean and modern, exactly what you need when staying away. The bathroom had a large shower but no bath. Breakfast is standard for Turkey, if a little strange for a English person. There seems to be no differentiation between breakfast and lunch with chip and roasted veg on offer. The location is a real winner, near to shops (big shopping centre like Westfield) restaurants, and some nice bars Dublin is a very nice one. Would definatey be happy to return to this hotel on my next visit."

The staff are young, welcoming and enthusiastic.  Breakfast is typically Turkish, but better than most. At the price they are currently charging it‚Äôs a real bargain. The one disappointment (and I hope it gets fixed soon) is that the wifi was unreliable in my room and not great in the lobby either.

This boutique hotel combining architectural simplicity with local touch is recently opened to accommodate the visitors of the adjacent OMM (Odunpazarƒ± Modern Museum) but, having visited Eski≈üehir for many times, I can recommend this hotel for all purpose stays, be it for business or touristic. It's located in the vibrant touristic neighborhood of the city, in walking distance to most of the city's touristic destinations.   When you first arrive, you are greeted with a drink. Check-in procedures are quick and flawless. We stayed in room no 7 and it was perfect in all sense: decoration, comfort, cleanliness, sleep quality, everything was impeccable.   The breakfast was legendary: it was both a visual and gastronomic feast.   Despite being more expensive that many hotels in town, I think this is \"the\" hotel to stay at when in Eski≈üehir.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "unfortunately had an unpleasant stay. the good thing was the location of the hotel. walking distance to Odunpazari.  there was no help offered to take our luggage to our floor or bring it down.. in the room, there was no soap in the lavatory. shower had a tube for liquid soap but was empty during our stay and wasnt replenished. the breakfast was minimal but you can get additional ommelette.. the weather was fantastic so we asked to sit at outside tables which is like 5 meters from tables inside..our request was turned down saying that other guests would want it too !!  One night, there was \"fasil\" with very loud music in the first floor till late, without thinking how the kids above floor would sleep in that noise. the price is good but I still would look for another place next time I visit Eskisehir.‚Ä¶"

If arriving by car, check in can be a bit of a nightmare with the very narrow streets making parking extremely difficult. The hotel advise that you can stop right outside but this spot is always occupied usually by a tradesman van or a delivery truck."

    "reviewtitle": "Renovating and saying wrong prices",
    "review": "I've stayed in several hostels especially since in Turkey it's difficult to use booking, but only now I feel the need to write a review about it.  I was just traveling through being very tired. A bit unlucky someone took my luggage by accident in the airport. So bad sleep and stress. But they were renovating and there was all day very loud noise in the hostel. So no resting.  It would have been nice to be notified about that. Girl in the evening was very friendly. But that day I asked about a bus to the airport. They might not realize I understand Turkish at some level. A bigger guy discussed it with I think a cleaning lady and they needed to know where I was from. Then just because I was from Belgium they decided to say no and said a taxi was about 50 lira. That's totally not true though. I first took a taxi and the correct price is on the screen. It was 33 lira. So I had my luggage back. Then I noticed there was a university at the airport and I saw busses constantly riding. A very nice young lady working there said I could take easily a bus to centre and checked me in with her card.  I think especially for a hostel this is very inappropriate behavior. The reason I choose this one and not the other actually nicer one was too many stairs and the deeps hostel in Ankara is very nice and helpful and wouldn't do such a thing. I'm getting tired with people thinking just because you are from Europe assuming you have money. I live under European poverty limit (healthissues) and can barely survive in my country as food and rent and co  is ridiculously expensive. Can I travel? It's basically cheaper than staying in the country sometimes. Anyways Moovit is a good application and works very well in Eski≈üehir. It told me perfectly how to go to the big busstation.  As most don't speak English I would advice to put a note that there are two kitchen. Cause you see the small one and most assume there is just one.  Beds are good. Lockers too. Showers too. The table next to the bed is a bit too low, because of that you need to close it at night and you can't put your stuff like phone etc anywhere.  All the other people were very nice though.‚Ä¶"

The entrance is poor. The building is new though. They asked for the payment before entering the room which is a negative. They insisted to prepare the invoice the night before sleeping since there would not be a knowledgable person to prepare in the morning. Breakfast was at 08:00. They prepared a special one for my early checkout. At least it was ready. Breakfast is average though. My room was small but newly built and decorated. However there are very many details which are not right. No place for soap during shower. No extra towels for shower. Had to ask them to bring. Towels were clean.  No light switch near the bed. Direct lighting from the ceiling which is disturbing when laying in the bed.  The furniture looks poor. There was no smell in the room. The bed and matresses were comfortable. The backside look to nearby apartments so you cannot have real privacy. This hotel is worth to stay for the price they charge, only. Can stay solo again for business overnight stays again.‚Ä¶"

It is in a wonderful location along the scenic canal of the town and it is full of staff that are helpful and energetic.  The room is huge and is nicely decorated. The breakfast is a large selection of fruits, cheeses, pastries, cereals and hot items. It is worth the trip up to the top floor to check it out. I was very happy with it. There are many nice little cafes and restaurants along the canal nearby as well. Definitely make this a stop on your travels. It's worth it. :)"

    "review": "We stayed here last year to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the last minute and we are very glad we made the choice. The staff were really helpful and upgraded us to make our anniversary even better. The location is wonderful, overlooking the Porsuk River and right in the middle of all the attractions and bars/cafes areas. The rooms are more that of a 5 star hotel rather than the 3 star that the Ad Life is listed as online which was a nice surprise. The TV selection was great and the bed was comfortable and clean. The only thing stopping this from fulfilling its' potential is the lack of leisure facilities such as a spa or fitness centre, otherwise this would be well above 3 star. Breakfast was good and the view from the restaraunt is wonderful. I would highly recommend‚Ä¶"

    "review": "A relatively new hotel in an excellent location. The gondola rides are just on the other side of the street (motorized but still cute!). The cost is TL15 per gondola, up to 4 people. Compare this with Venice!  If you come to Eskisehir by bus, there is a tram from the bus station to downtown that passes very close to the hotel.  Balconies are too small to put a chair.Parts of the  wallpaper in the rooms need fixing. Some written information about the equipment in the rooms would be helpful. For example,it takes a while to figure out that one should turn the door handle up to lock the balcony door!  The buffet breakfast  served on the terrace is excellent. Same is true for the pub/restaurant on the ground floor.  Overall this is a nice hotel and can be much nicer with some touch‚Ä¶"

Although our room was a non-smoking room, at night there was a very little smoke smell, it might come from a smoking-allowed rooms? I don‚Äôt know but it might be an improvement point for the hotel.

    "review": "Let me first mention that the room price of the hotel is very adventageous. Almost a dormitory price... Compared to what you pay the hotel offers quite much: Large rooms, comfortable beds and proximity to historical Odunpazari center. First room I was offered had a heavy cigarette odour, the second room was OK. The bathroom was not dirty but I perceived a superficial cleaning. The cleaning staff must spend more time in the room and make an in-depth cleaning. There is no air conditioning but I could sleep without it quite good even in mid-summer. I may stay here again during next trips to Eski≈üehir."

He asked my husband who is Turkish to ask me what I want to see in Eskisehir, went downstairs and came up with a map and a guided book on Eskishir. We obviously went to tip him as we do in every hotel and he was quite embarrassed and didn‚Äôt want to accept the money. We have travelled the whole of Turkey, mostly staying in 5 star hotels and have not met such a humble, lovely man. A true credit to this hotel. The room itself was very comfortable, clean and spacious. It was obviously not 5 star but good for the price, location and age. The breakfast was lovely. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone. Bravo to the management on employing such great staff. ‚Ä¶"

Breakfast was very good for a three star hotel.Most four star hotels in Europe don't serve this much variety.However there was no fresh coffee but instant coffee and mate in packs.We met nice people at reception,they presented us  a map of places we should visit. The only thing that bothered us was the lack of light in the bathroom.Foreign tourists will certainly want to watch some tv channel at least in English,however there is none.‚Ä¶"

I paid for both nights and argued and refused to pay again! This was disappointing and I suggest guests insist on being given a receipt. Otherwise, it was good value, and will stay again. "

Entered the dipping pool with water up to 45deg C. A lion head was spouting water at one end and the pool was surrounded with individual basins with hot & cold taps.  I engaged the services for the \"kese\", body scrub and it was incredible to see the amount of dead skin cells being scrubbed off and washed away, feeling clean like never before. The service less than the entrance fee.  One can remain in the pool area for as long you want but I went to the upper floor for an hour long soothing and relaxing massage. The massage services varies fro  30 dakika to 60 dakika.  Just remember to drink plenty of water."

    "review": "I traveled in Turkey last year July and spent 3 nights in this Hotel. Just upon arrival confused receptionist charged me wrong amount (60 lira instead of 60 euro). I requested 3 floor room and I got it. But I had to change it withing 5 min, since door lock of the room was broken, and doors didn't closed properly; and since it was top floor bathroom ceiling was horribly molded. Luckily I got other room fast and in better condition. But bathroom was still quite dirty and poorly maintained (shower doors did closed). Most disappointing was breakfast - way before breakfast finish time I could find peace of bread, 5 olives and butter (no meat, no vegetables, no cheese) and black tea (NO COFFEE?). I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone until it solves all its issues.  Location was very good, but its center of market - noise is inevitable.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "When we entered the hotel, it was without a lift and just undergoing various repairs; but, by the time we were leaving, it was already running. A good thing.    We planned to stay just 1 night, but - pleasantly surprised by the beauty of Eskisehir, a town situated on 2 rivers, prolonged our stay to even 3 nights.     Together with Amasya, Eskisehir became ours' favourite city in Turkey.    As especially interesting sightseeing place, I would recommend to anyone the old city in Eskisehir (Odunpazari).    Our next trip will be either to Amasya, or Eskisehir, or both towns (depending on time and money, of course).     Anyway, if we go to Eskisehir, we'll certainly stay at Deda Thermal Hotel.    And, although it was not important to us, maybe we shoud add a location of a thermal bath, just on the other side of a street.    We like their owner and receptionists, who speak very good English and are always so willing to help you with any kind of information.

Talking about the hotel them self, honestly I love they are loby who full of lavender and classic touch of the furniture.   The room size normal the bath room have litle problem with they are shower who broken so the water come out from anywhere. We staying 2 night and they are not clean our room even to clean the rubbish. But, we still can handel for this.   The most Iam focus is the sound from the other room. We are staying in the room near the reception and when people in 2nd floor walking we can hear the sound from wooden floor is really distrubing.  For the breakfirst they are done so well, and the man who take care this place is really friendly and nice.  overall, still recommend this place for you to stay. Just ask them to give you room in the 2nd floor to avoid the disturbing sound during you stay.‚Ä¶"

The cobbled pathways and the stone steps (there are no lifts) are not baggage-friendly and the rooms are rather dark and somwhat small.

    "review": "This hotel was our emergency exit as we did not initially planned to stay in Eski≈üehir. But we liked the hotel and the area.   It is in an area called Odunpazarƒ± where old buildings are restored to be hotel and museum which is quite nice. It has a nice garden, a restaurant.   Room was basic but nice, extremely comfy pillow btw! However there was live music at the restaurant and it was loud. Breakfast was fresh and nice with one thing missing: Decent coffee! I think in a hotel in this range, there should at least be filter coffee. And in the restaurant they actually serve Italian coffee so I don't know what the problem is with breakfast. That was the biggest downside for us.   I could never use this free wifi but since we stayed just one night, I didn't try to solve the problem‚Ä¶"

The staff spoke just enough English between them and together with their computer managed to direct us to the Museum and an afternoon's adventure. They were so helpful and friendly. Lovely Konak, beautifully restored backing onto an arcade with nice shops and restaurants where we ate our evening meal and wonderful breakfast. It is situated in the old part of Eskisehir and a delight to walk around, chat to the locals and look in some of their amazing shops - the toy shop was my favourite where the toys were made on site. Just delightful.... The Firuz was our base to explore this fascinating area. It was organized by Rock Valley Tours in Urgup.‚Ä¶"

The rooms are spacious unlike the similar hotels in that area. Very comfortable and big bed, duck feather blankets, pillow menu, complimentary water & tea & coffee in the room. Bathroom is very nice, handmade decorated sinks made of K√ºtahya tile.  The decoration is perfect, you realize the beauty of the wooden floors & ceilings, the atmosphere inside the building is very cosy. Its very close to main attractions of the old city. Nice area to stay. The breakfast is one of the best ever, the homemade jams, egg choices, tasty cheeses and different fresh vegetables and various types of b√∂rek & breads.  I will definitely come back to this hotel whenever I come to this city again.  It is a 5 star comfort but a VIP boutique experience.  Thanks again and hope to be back soon.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "Fantastically positioned both for tourism and for shopping in this great city in Turkey. The tram station is opposite to the hotel. The welcoming and rather friendly staff with an infectious smile is an admired selling point. The hotel like elsewhere in the city is very clean. The suite room that we stayed in was large and the bed was fantastic. Because of the paucity of foreign tourists , as I thought, there was a lack of an English T.V. channel. The breakfast was basic but if you want eggs you can ask for. The only negative point about this hotel was the lack of an elevator (lift) which may make the life of someone with angina or joint problems a little difficult especially if your room was on a high floor level"

    "review": "My family and I recently stayed at the Bello Butiq Hotel in Eskisehir and we were extremely happy with our choice.  The location was very central to the city sights; the room was immaculately clean; breakfast was delicious and served in an artful way by friendly and helpful staff; and most of all, the hosts went well beyond expectations in assisting us during our stay.  When we arrived late in the evening, we discovered that my reservation made through Hotels.com had omitted the information that there would be 3 adults (me,my husband, and adult son) sharing a room.  The young man on night duty was a bit uncomfortable with his level of English comprehension and, although it was late, called the owner who spoke with me by phone regarding how to handle the situation (since the room had been prepaid with Hotel.com).  With absolutely no hint of annoyance, the night staff of two young men carried a large roll-away bed up three flights of stairs and set it up in our room.  As a second example, we were interested in visiting the Phrygian Valley and did not have a car.  The young man working the front desk spent considerable effort calling around to taxi companies and private tour guides.  When it turned out that arranging a company tour was not financially feasible, he helped us plan a way to make the trip via public transportation involving a bus trip to a small village and hiring a local to drive us to the sights of interest.  The trip worked out really well and we strongly recommend a visit to see the amazing historical sights and spectacular landscape.  We highly recommend the Bello Butik Hotel and would definitely stay there again should we be fortunate enough to visit Eskisehir again.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "Located quite centrally at a downtown corner, Bello Butik is an apartment building turned into a small hotel. It can easily be reached by tram or bus, or shared cabs. It is close to the shopping centers, places of interest and nightlife. Unfortunately, because it is located on a busy street, the traffic can be heard incessantly. The reception and staff were quite helpful and friendly.  The rooms are small, but spacious and clean; the amenities plenty and of quality. Breakfast is served however we did not have any, so I cannot say anything about it. I would recommend Bello Butik for short stays."

The reception and check-in was effortless and we were greeted by a smile and a very warm welcome by very pleasant, hospitable and  smart appearance staff.  We were shown to our room along bright, clean landings. Our room was immaculately clean and very fresh. The bathroom was perhaps a little small, never the less, it was clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable and we slept very well. The ambience is quiet and tranquil may be because there are no bar facilities and bar noise. There was a mini bar available containing soft drinks and water. The price for these drinks were very reasonable.  The breakfast at the top Sky lounge was remarkable. Freshly presented breakfast fare. Hot and Cold food. Good quality.  There are plenty of caf√©s and bars within minutes -if not seconds walking distance. Good quality Wifi was readily available. Reception and hotel staff were always hospitable and of kind attitude.   We would most certainly check-in to this wonderful hotel again.   Recommended?... yes!,most certainly.   Thank you.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "This is a great hotel, but it could be a fantastic hotel.  It has a prime location with a tram stop across the street.  The maintenance is great--unusual for some Turkish hotels.  Everything works.  There are safes in the rooms.  The wireless internet is fabulous, and they post the password next to your telephone.  The rooms are clean, the A/C is easy to operate, the windows have screens.  The breakfast buffet is rich and tasty, and the staff at the front desk is friendly and helpful.  Too good to be true?  It is.  Unfortunately, the whole place smells like cigarette smoke.  If only they had smoking and non-smoking floors, this place would be fantastic.  If you are bothered by cigarette smoke, do not stay here, as you will be very uncomfortable.    Turkey is slowly realizing the dangers of cigarette smoking, and I have no doubt that sooner or later this hotel will realize the benefits of separating out their smokers--and maybe, if all goes well, elminating them all together from the premises.‚Ä¶"

The concierge and his staff, they knew it all and one more! They gave us very good advice on everything.  3. the housekeeping is clean and quick and deserves trust, we loved their honesty; when in the morning we left behind us bunches of golden bracelets and banknotes not suitable for hospital life, we have found everything piled over the desk, always always always, and nothing was EVER missing.

I was hoping for basic accomodation, a comfortable and clean room with a clean bath room and toilet. When I arrived at the room I booked, I immediately felt like something was off. There was a disgusting and very strong mold odor in the room. I opened the door of the bathroom and it was clear that the mold odor was coming from there. The ceiling was hanging loose and I felt like it could collapse any moment. The water in the bath tub was literally leaking so the floor was super wet when I finished showering, which is very dangerous. The things in the bathroom were also disgusting, the trash bin and toilet brush were rusty. How much does it cost to change a damn trash bin??? I advice y'all never EVER to book a room at this place because it was the most disgusting hotel ever. Never will they see me back.‚Ä¶"

Emre, the host is a very friendly person and he always welcomes you with a smile.  There is a pub in the \"Barlar Sokagi\" with the same name, and you should definitely give it a visit.

    "review": "Many thanks to Ben, Nihal and their team for making our weekend trip a truely pleasant one. We find Midas Han the perfect place for exploring the many historical sites in the area either by taking a walk directly from the hotel or after a short drive. Ben is always ready to show you around or to provide detailed guidance on the different sites to visit. Time flies when sitting around the inside fireplace or outside in the garden in the evening and listening to Ben or to one of the visiting archeologists talking about the history of the region. The hearty breakfast provides the right basis before setting out for the walks and visits. Do not miss out on the three-course dinners offered (you need to book the same in advance). Definitely not our last trip to and stay in Midas Han."

    "review": "In case you want to explore the archeological gem of the Phrygian Valley, Midas Han is the perfect base camp for you: it's pretty much the only decent place you may find around but more important than that, Ben, the owner, is an incredible source of knowledge.   We spent the whole day at Midas Han, went there early in the morning, then had a very detailed tour with Ben, then had lunch at Midas Han and continued our archeological tour in the area until sunset and then headed home. So, we did not stay at night but nevertheless experienced the place.   The location is quite unique as it's placed just in the middle of the \"history\" with an outstanding view of Yazilikaya. The overall atmosphere is  comfortable yet humble, exactly what you need from a base camp when exploring a site such as Phrygian Valley.   Ben's guidance is priceless: he's very knowledgeable about the area and the history. In fact he's too knowledgeable and it might be overwhelming time to time in case you are not that into archeology.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place and Ben's guiding services if you intend to explore Phrygian Valley.‚Ä¶"

    "review": "Midas Han proved to be the perfect base for the week we spent hiking the Phrygian Way and sight-seeing the stunning rock-cut architecture scattered around the landscape. All of the best sites are located within easy walking distance of the hotel.  Midas Han is located on the outskirts of the village of √áukurca and has open views out over fields to Gerdekkaya Anti, a rocky tufa outcrop with a huge temple facade carved into its face.   The small cluster of buildings at Midas Han are recently constructed but in a very traditional style, using locally produced stone and timber. The attention to detail, both in the buildings and their contents is really noteworthy and shows that the whole place, including the beautiful garden has been lovingly crafted by the owners. The main building is a large two-story stone structure with a long timber balcony that looks out over the fields. Inside is an open-plan communal dining area and lounge with lots of interesting artefacts on the walls and beams, from Anatolian ceramics to old farm equipment and even an old bird cage! A place of real character!  Our room was very comfortable and traditionally appointed, with a wood-burning stove and en-suite toilet and shower with hot water all the time. Some of the other rooms are heated with radiators. The price for our accommodation included a delicious, traditional Turkish evening meal and breakfast. Fresh g√∂zleme is prepared on one of several ovens in the garden.  One of the owners, who used to work as an archaeology teacher, even took us on a walk out to the nearby Midas City and really brought the place to life with his good-humoured and fascinating tour of this spectacular site.  A visit to Midas Han is a must for any traveller to this part of Phrygia.   ‚Ä¶"

The staff are very nice, there is a breakfast room (the breakfast is not awesome but it is adequate), a comfortable TV room/lounge, and good wifi. The price is very reasonable. It is not an obvious place to stay (there are nicer places in Eskisehir and Ankara, and Polatli is also an option if you are going to visit King Midas), but it is a good place to stay!

Elimizde cok fazla esyayla 1 gun hatta 1 saatte bulduk burayi mecbur giris yaptik. Oncelikle odemeyi giris yapmadan israrla istediler. Neyse girdik zar zor esyalari tasidik ev berbat otesi ama bi sekilde temizledim duzenledim idare ederiz zaten 1 hafta kalicaz dedim cikmadik. Her gun sabah 5 e kadar gurultu. Kavga kahkaha sarki ve afedersiniz baska seyler. Du≈ü basligi kirikti zaten banyo le≈ü gibi. Koltuk desen yirtik sigara yanigi dolu buzdolabi bozuk. Bide Gunluk 100 tl istiyorlar.

But, when you walk about 10 minutes, you can reach plenty of good places to hang out. The rooms are clean, well furnished and  spacious enough. The breakfast is good and tasty. So, over all, I recommend this hotel mainly to business travellers who has someone local to take you out for a drink or dinner. Enjoy your stay..."

Though the hotel is not close to the city centre and doesn't have a bar if you need sometimes such, I found a shop in 10 min form it you can get there anything except clothes.  Five day breakfast was the same, but for me everything was tasty. So if you need a calm place to rest from very young and energetic city it could be the right choice."

    "review": "Due to a holiday weekend and a last minute reservation, we were able to find a room only in this hotel. It's sad that it is called a hotel because it was made out from a small apartment building. The stinging odor in the rooms was overwhelmingly bothersome. The rooms reeked cigarette smoke and old humid walls. Each room has an outrageously old wall papers which also smelled disgusting. The staff seemed pretty disinterested. The beds are very uncomfortable and dusty. The bathrooms don't have shower cabins and the faucets hardly run any water. The floors are extremely dirty. The breakfast was ridiculous as well. No one should stay there as the conditions of the hotel are very unhealthy. "
